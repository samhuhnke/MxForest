## Content

This repo contains tools and methods to process and analyze data from the *Mexican National Forest Inventory (INFyS)*. This entails a code for cleaning the data, one for pre-processing the data so it can be used in python, one for analyzing the data, and the python code used to run an iteratively reweighted multivariate alteration detection on the data. 


## Data and Availability

The data are part of the National Forest and Soil Inventory (INFyS) of Mexico between 2004 and 2019. The inventory encompasses measures of forest status, composition, and disturbances, as well as measures of soil availability and health.

The INFyS follows a stratified sampling approach, resulting in 26,220 mapped plots. Each plot consists of four subplots, which are used as sampling sites. Each plot was visited every 5 years.

The data are publicly accessible under: ***INSERT LINK***
